                    The Internet is a global network of computer devices, over which data can be transferred. This data transfer allows for many functions to be completed such as, sending messages, completing transactions, streaming videos and downloading content .

                    <p class="articleConent">
                    The Internet is made of an interconnecting network of computers. These computers can be connected physically, using copper wire or fibre optic cables, or through wireless connections such as WiFi or 5G. Requests for data over the internet are handled by a series of routers that route packets (each containing a part of the whole request) to the appropriate place where they are reconstructed and read. Then if any data needs to be sent back to the original requester, then it is returned using the same method. The set of protocols responsible for this data transfer over the internet is called the TCP/IP stack.

                    How has the Internet contributed to society?
                    </h4>
                    <p class="articleConent">
                    The Internet is used and contributes to almost every aspect of our current society. The transfer of information on a global scale has allowed for improvements in so many areas including education, academic research and enabling communications between previously disconnected people.
                    The Internet has revolutionised education. Whilst in the past people required many physical, often costly, resources such as books and teachers to learn, now they can access much of the collective world's knowledge with just a few simple searches. Videos and worksheets shared over the internet make it simple to access educational resources, which has allowed people who previously would not have the opportunity to access education to study and learn.
                    The Internet also contributes to the betterment of society through streamlining crucial research and collaborative projects. Through the Internet, teams on different sides of the world can communicate with near instantaneous results- allowing easier collaboration. This sped-up, global communication allows for knowledge and expertise to be pooled, in turn leading to more impactful and impressive project results.
                    This communication supported by the internet also has positive social impacts. Previously isolated people and communities now have an easier method of interaction with others. Grandparents living far away can talk to their grandchildren over a simple online video call, and those feeling isolated within their community can contact likeminded people online. This human connection, enabled by the Internet, helps reduce loneliness and improve mental health.
                    The Internet has contributed to society in many different ways and as its uses and capabilities are constantly being further developed, its contributions are likely to grow and strengthen along with it.
